🎂✨ Happy Birthday ✨🎂
To the girl who doesn’t even realise how special she truly is…

Today isn’t just your birthday  it’s the day the universe quietly created someone who would one day change the world without even trying. You don’t have to do anything extraordinary… your smile already does more than you can imagine. My only wish today is simple: May God keep you happy, peaceful and loved  today and always.

You always ask me many questions & today i will answers all of that🙂

💙 Q1. You choose the wrong girl

No matter what you think about yourself, you are the sweetest, greatest, and most amazing person in my eyes. I’m glad I found you in this lifetime, in this chaos, in a world full of passing faces. You’re not just someone I met  you’re someone I feel safe with. When you’re near, the noise fades, time slows down, and everything feels right. You are the only one I always mention in my prayers. And if you think you’re the “wrong girl,” let me tell you something… you are not wrong  you’re real. You’re genuine. You’re pure hearted. You feel deeply even when you hide it. You care silently even when you pretend you don’t. You carry a softness inside you that the world rarely understands. People made you doubt yourself not because you’re wrong, but because you're rare and rare things are often misunderstood. You’re the girl who gives more than she receives, who holds pain but still smiles, who stays strong even when you tired. You think you’re “too much” or “not enough,” while someone prays for someone exactly like you, Its can be your parents , your friend. I didn’t choose you because you’re perfect, I chose you because you’re you and that’s more than enough. I care about your heart, your soul, your silence, and your softness. You’re not the wrong girl, you’re the right one… you just don’t see it yet.

💜 Q2. You will find someone better?

 See ‘better’ koi insaan nahi hota ‘better’ ek feeling hoti hai. Aur jo feeling tumhare saath aati hai, woh tumhari personality ki wajah se hai. Tum special isliye ho kyunki tumhari baatein real hoti hain, tumhara nature simple aur grounded rehta hai, aur tum situations ko samajhne ka ek alag hi tarika rakhti ho. Tum woh insaan ho jinke saath baat karke samay ko rokh dene ka man karta hai. Tumhari honesty, tumhara patience, tumhara humor, aur tumhari maturity yeh sab qualities har kisi mein nahi milti.

Tum hai mai kisi se compare ya replace nahi kar ne k bare mai soch bhi nahi sakta. Tumhari value kisi doosre se behtar ya kam behtar hone se decide nahi hoti. Tumhari value tumhari khud ki individuality mein hai jis tarah tum sochti ho, jis tarah tum feel karti ho, aur jis tarah tum dusron ko comfort deti ho, woh sab tumhe naturally alag banata hai.

Isliye jab tum poochti ho ki kya mujhe koi ‘better’ mil jaayega, toh jawab simple hai: main ‘better’ dhun hi nahi raha. Mujhe sirf itna pata hai ki tum jaisi personality or nahi milti. Tumhari khas baat yahi hai ki tum impress karne ki koshish nahi karti… phir bhi tumhara impact reh jaata hai. Aur jo log naturally yaad reh jaayein, unka koi alternative nahi hota and i am so glad to get you as my friend.

💚 Q3. Why you wait so long?

Because waiting is often the most beautiful part of any story. Anticipation makes every moment feel deeper. Even Lord Krishna had to wait for Radha. When you care for someone truly, you don’t wait with expectations you wait with patience. When you truly love someone, you can wait for them without expectations or conditions. If we start expecting then it become like a trade.Thats not how love work Love is like a dharma ,a duty to care, to do good, and to never think bad, no matter the situation.  Have you ever seen your parents, they never expect anything from you , if they do, they want to see you happy, In every moments they want to see you smiling, They do lots of efforts just to see you happy, That's called real love. You may have notice when they wait for you , for dinner. Thats love. I’ve seen you go quiet many times  your eyes still, thinking deeply, searching for answers. Your eyes speak more than your words ever could. If you’re busy, I’ll wait. If you’re sad, I’ll listen. If you need help, I’ll be there. No matter what happens, you’re never alone. I know I may not be perfect, but one thing is certain I will never leave your side. If you need help, I’ll be Doraemon, if you need a smile, I’ll be Shinchan, if you need strength, I’ll be Chhota Bheem, if you’re bored, I’ll be Jerry. I’ll always stay by your side, the way the river’s two shores follow each other through every turn.

💛 Q4.Why me?

I saw you with my heart, not my eyes , and trust me, you are the most beautiful person I have ever seen. You matter to me more than you think and more than I show. Every story begins with your smile and ends in your eyes.. I tried to describe you, but every metaphor fell short, even the stars felt ordinary when I looked into your eyes, and the moon hid behind the clouds when you walked through that door. Every poem I wrote ended up sounding like your name , how can I define someone who makes the universe feel small? You are not just beautiful, you are the reason why poetry exists. There may be billions, but none of them are you. If I had to pick between your happiness and mine, I’d choose yours without a second thought, because when you’re happy, I automatically become happy too. My relation with you isn’t like rain that comes and goes , it’s like air, always around you even when silent. I will be always with you, no matter what happens, in a world full of doubt, you’re the one I’m sure about. You’re special to me because you’re the only person I genuinely want to see happy from the bottom of my heart, and every time I look at you, something inside me whispers, “God, please keep her happy at any cost.” I’ve never felt this way for anyone before ,that’s why you’ll always be special. 

🩷 Q5. One day you will forget me.

Nahi yaar… main tumhe kaise bhool sakta hoon. Tum to mujhe yaad ho chuke ho. Sach kahun toh tum woh insaan ho jo life mein aakar sirf reh nahi jaate, balki kuch na kuch badal hi dete ho. Tumhari baatein, tumhari hasi, aur tumhara cheezon ko samajhne ka tareeka… yeh sab tumhari strength hai, aur yeh strength sirf tum mai hi hai. Kabhi kabhi toh lagta hai ki jitni bhi confusion, stress ya tension hoti hai, tumse baat karke woh thodi halki si ho jaati hai. Tumhari presence, chahe message mein ho ya baat cheet mein, ek ajeeb si simplicity aur comfort le aati hai.
Aur haan, ek baat aur… jaise tumne mujhe support diya hai, waise hi main bhi chahta hoon ki kabhi tumhe kuch chahiye ho, koi sunne wala ho, ya tumhare din ko thoda halka karne wala ho, toh main bhi utna hi present rahun. Aur main genuinely tumhare liye woh support banna chahta hoon.I am always with you.
Aur jab koi insaan itna comfort de jaaye, itni positivity de jaaye, toh usse bhoolna koi practical baat nahi hoti. Kuch log life mein place lete hain, par tumne place nahi li tumne ek impact chhoda hai. Impact wahi hota hai jo dil aur dimaag dono ko touch kare, aur phir chahe waqt badal jaaye ya situation, woh impact jaata nahi.
Isliye agar tum phir se poochho ki main tumhe bhool jaaunga, toh jawab hamesha ek hi rahega: tum sirf yaad nahi, ek ehsaas ban chuki ho. Aur ehsaas kabhi khatam nahi hote… woh saath chalte rehte hain.

💖 Q6: The Promise

I’m promising you something simple but honest: I will never change. Whether you’re 21, 40, 60, or 80, I still want to see that same warm smile brightening your face. And if life ever gives me even the smallest chance to bring that smile back on a tough day, I’ll use that chance with all my heart.

I’ll always be there for you. If life ever becomes heavy, if the world ever feels overwhelming, I hope you remember that you don’t have to go through everything alone. If I could, I would swap your bad days with my good ones, your rough time with my calm time, your boring moments with my exciting ones, your confusion with my clarity, your tired evenings with my peaceful ones, and your worries with my strength just so your journey feels a little lighter.

I want to hold your tired hand , take does sadness, tieredness & handed my energy,fun. And whenever you need help, support, or simply a steady presence beside you, I’ll be there without hesitation. I’ll share your dreams, remind you of the strength you sometimes forget you have, celebrate every quiet victory, and walk with you toward every hope you carry in your heart. You’ll never have to face your challenges alone. I’ll be the calm beside your storm, the voice that lifts you up, and the person who chooses you—again and again

People like you carry a softness and honesty that the world doesn’t always protect, and all I want is for life to treat you gently. I’ll cheer for you when you rise, stand by you when you’re unsure, and remind you of your worth when you forget it yourself. You will always have someone who wants to see you win, someone who wants your days to feel lighter, someone who genuinely cares enough to stay


🌟 Closing Message

At the end of everything, there’s just one simple truth: I’m genuinely grateful you exist. Life will take us through different paths, ups and downs, but I’ll always hope you find the kind of happiness that feels light, peaceful, and yours because you’re a genuinely good person and you deserve good things. Thank you for being someone worth appreciating, someone whose presence makes days a little easier, someone who unknowingly brings softness into the world just by being herself. Once again, Happy Birthday. You deserve every gentle, honest, and beautiful moment life has to offer. 💛
