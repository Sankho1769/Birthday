Then i realised  dono jahano mai tumsa kohi nahi (Nahi dharti main , nahi swarg mai) 

Juhi,You are a vision soft and kind,
A blend of beauty, soul, and mind.
So calm, so pure, so deeply true.
You moves with grace, You breathes in peace,
And turns each moment into ease.

Your face, a poem carved by light,
Where day meets dream and wrong meets right.
No mask of pride, no shade of lies,
Just gentle truth behind your eyes.
Your calm expression, soft and clear,
Brings peace to all who stand near.

Your eyes, two worlds that softly gleam,
Half in thought and half in dream.
They do not seek to conquer hearts,
But heal through calm and gentle parts.
They hold a depth both wise and wide,
Where truth and tenderness reside.

Your hair, a river dark and free,
Flowing with quiet dignity.
Each strand a thought, each wave a song,
That’s drifted peacefully along.
It moves with grace, it shines with ease,
Like whispered words the soul can’t seize.

Your cheeks, where laughter likes to stay,
Hold dimples deep in their own way.
When joy awakes, they softly bloom,
And turn all gray to golden room.
They are the proof that life can smile,
And make the wait for joy worthwhile.

Your smile, a dawn in human form,
So calm, so tender, pure, and warm.
It doesn’t shout, it doesn’t boast,
Yet warms each soul that needs it most.
It heals the air, it melts the pain,
And brings the sun through clouds again.

Your ears, they listen, not to hear,
But feel what hearts keep hidden near.
No judgment lives within your gaze,
you understands in quiet ways.
you knows the world in tone and sound,
Where meaning more than words is found.

Your voice, so steady, soft, and sure,
Carries a power calm and pure.
Each word is placed with gentle thought,
Each phrase a lesson life has taught.
you never seeks to sound profound,
Yet leaves her wisdom all around.

Your laughter, light as drops of rain,
A song that washes off the pain.
It doesn’t linger, doesn’t fade,
Just leaves behind the joy it made.
It fills the air with sweet release,
A melody of quiet peace.

The way you eats, serene and neat,
As though each meal were calm and sweet.
you tastes with care, with grace, with prayer,
Grateful for what the world prepares.
Your calm in moments small and still,
Shows discipline wrapped in goodwill.

Your hobbies, small, yet pure delight,
Reflect your heart so warm and light.
you keeps keychains from places gone,
Like stories resting one by one.
And balloons, you loves their flight,
Their colors mirror your delight.

Your silence, not of loss or fear,
But peace the restless long to hear.
When storms arrive, you stays composed,
A strength the world has not yet posed.
Your quiet calm, your steady grace,
Turns chaos into soft embrace.

Your dreams, they shine through every night,
With gentle hope and fearless light.
you dreams not grand of crown or fame,
But better worlds, not just your name.
In dreams yoy builds, you grows, you learns,
And every loss to wisdom turns.

Your patience, vast as morning sky,
you lets the moments drift, not fly.
you knows what blooms begins in seed,
you trusts the heart before the deed.
Each waiting hour, each quiet phase,
Refines your soul in subtle ways.

Yet when you stands for what is right,
Your eyes turn fierce, your soul alight.
No fear can shake your steady will,
Your calm grows sharper, brighter still.
You fights not loud, but firm and fair,
With truth as armor everywhere.

You lives so simply, yet so whole,
With purpose deep within your soul.
A cup of tea, a book, a song,
Are all you needs to feel she’s strong.
Your peace resides not in your place,
But in your heart’s unhurried grace.

Your presence leaves a sacred air,
A warmth that whispers, “She was there.”
No perfume’s trace, no fleeting show,
Just peace that lingers soft and slow.
You turns the ordinary bright,
By just existing in the light.

In art and books, You finds your peace,
Your restless thoughts in them release.
In music’s tone or poet’s word,
Your truest voice is softly heard.
You paints, You reads, You dreams,
Where life is more than what it seems.

Your hands, they build, they heal, they guide,
They craft with love and steady pride.
No gesture wasted, none too small,
Your care is written in them all.
They speak of work, of heart, of art,
The language born from soul and heart.

Your soul, so pure, so bright, so deep,
Where faith and hope together sleep.
No greed, no envy, no disguise,
Just calm truth living in your eyes.
You gives, forgives, you lifts, you learns,
You glows through all that life returns.

Your kindness, endless, quiet, wide,
A flowing warmth you cannot hide.
You heals the world through gentle deeds,
By tending others’ unseen needs.
Your joy is found where others rise,
you love reflected in their eyes.

Your skill, in every path you tries,
A spark of excellence never dies.
From art to thought, from word to deed,
You blends you grace with will to lead.
You learns, you teaches, you inspires,
And fuels you world with quiet fires.

You leaves behind, where’er you been,
A softer world, a brighter scene.
Your presence plants what words can’t show,
And makes the hearts you touches grow.
Through you, the world learns how to be,
Strong, yet soft, with dignity.

You walks with calm, you breathes with care,
Your spirit sweetens every air.
Your being humans with life’s embrace,
A timeless art, a quiet grace.
You is not beauty for the eyes,
But truth made flesh, serene and wise.
